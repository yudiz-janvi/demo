                        Please read these terms of service and our privacy policy carefully because they govern your use
                        of the website and interface located at https:// nfttalent.io., which facilitates interaction
                        with certain decentralized cryptographic protocols, which we do not own or control, to
                        effectuate the creation and deployment (“minting”) of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and support
                        sale and distribution of such NFTs on the decentralized blockchains on which the NFTs are
                        recorded (“blockchain”). to make these terms easier to read, the site, our services, and the app
                        are collectively called the “services.”

                        Important notice regarding arbitration: when you agree to these terms, you agree (with limited
                        exception) to resolve any dispute between you and nfttalent.io through binding, individual
                        arbitration rather than in court. Please review carefully section 18, “dispute resolution,”
                        below for details regarding arbitration. However, if you are a resident of a jurisdiction where
                        applicable law prohibits the arbitration of disputes, the agreement to arbitrate in section 18
                        will not apply to you, but the provisions of section 17 (governing law) will apply instead.

                                crawling, web harvesting, data mining, data extraction, scraping or aggregating

                            <h5>(a) The NFT TALENT Platform</h5>
                            <p>
                                Our Services facilitate interactions with the Protocols and Blockchains to allow
                                individuals to bid on, purchase, trade, and sell NFTs. NFT TALENT provides the

                                Blockchains. NFT TALENT does not provide the Protocol. Our Services also
                                allows users to create and deploy NFTs

                            <p>
                                (i) You may participate in the Services by linking your digital wallet(s) on
                                supported bridge extensions, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in
                                transactions using Solana cryptocurrency. Before putting up your unique digital
                                asset for sale or putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset from another
                                user, we will ask you to download a supported electronic wallet extension and
                                connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an
                                order to sell or purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the
                                applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (ii) NFT TALENT platform is not a broker, financial institution, or creditor. the
                                services are an administrative platform only. NFT TALENT facilitates transactions
                                between the purchaser and seller on the NFT TALENT platform but is not a party
                                to any agreement between the purchaser and seller of nfts or between any users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (iii) You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and
                                authenticity of assets you purchase through the NFT TALENT platform.
                                Notwithstanding indicators and messages that suggest verification, NFT TALENT
                                makes no claims about the identity, legitimacy, or authenticity of assets on the
                                platform.
                            </p>

                            <h5>(b) Transactions Are Conducted on the Blockchain</h5>
                            <p>
                                While NFT TALENT offers a platform for NFTs, it does not buy, sell or take
                                custody or possession of any NFTs, nor does it act as an agent or custodian for any
                                user of the Services. Instead, each NFT that is listed for sale will be deposited into
                                a blockchain-based smart contract deployed by NFT TALENT to ensure that the
                                purported seller owns such NFT. Each such NFT is released automatically upon
                                consummation of its sale through the relevant Blockchain network If you elect to
                                mint, buy, or sell any NFTs, any transactions that you engage in will be conducted
                                solely through the relevant Blockchain network governing such NFT. You will be
                                required to make or receive payments exclusively through the cryptocurrency
                                wallet you have connected to the NFT TALENT Platform. We will have no insight
                                into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to
                                reverse any transactions. Accordingly, we will have no liability to you or to any
                                third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions
                                that you engage in via the Service. There may be royalties associated with the
                                secondary sale of any NFT. You acknowledge and agree that the payment of any
                                such royalty shall, in certain circumstances, be programmed to be self-executing
                                via a blockchain network’s nonfungible token standard and NFT TALENT does
                                not have any control or ability to direct such funds or the obligation to collect such
                                fees.
                            </p>

                            <h5>(c) Promotions Programs</h5>
                            <p>
                                Your participation in certain programs (e.g., promotions, sweepstakes, giveaways,
                                contests, etc.) made available through the NFT TALENT Platform will be subject
                                to additional terms and conditions specific to such programs as set forth by the
                                sponsor of each promotion.
                            </p>

                            <h5>(d) Terms Applicable to Purchasers and Sellers</h5>
                            <p>
                                If you are using the Services to purchase NFTs, you are a “Purchaser,” and if you
                                are using the Services to sell NFTs, you are a “Seller.” If you are either a Purchaser
                                or Seller, you agree to the following additional terms:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (i) Purchase Terms. Although the terms of sale for an NFT are displayed on the
                                NFT TALENT Platform, all such terms are determined by the Purchasers and
                                Sellers and the sale and purchase of NFTs are subject to such (e.g., with respect to

                                disputes arising out of or related to the authenticity of the NFT or any intellectual
                                property rights associated with such NFT. The Purchaser and Seller are entirely
                                responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing Purchase
                                Terms, and for resolving any disputes arising from any breach of any Purchase

                                in the purchase terms, you have a license to use the NFT Content solely for the
                                following purposes: (1) for Purchaser’s own personal, non-commercial use; (2)
                                attempts to sell or otherwise dispose of the NFT consistent with the ownership of
                                it; and (3) as part of a third party offering compatible with the purchased NFT in
                                the normal course of the permitted end-use of such offering.

                                fees that NFT TALENT

                                Site or otherwise set forth in these Terms. “Revenue” means the gross amount paid
                                by the Purchaser of a sale of your NFT on the NFT TALENT Platform. You
                                further agree to pay all other applicable fees, including Gas Fees and hosting fees,
                                and you authorize NFT TALENT
                                to automatically charge you for any such fees or deduct such fees (including the
                                Transaction Fee) directly from your amounts paid by the Purchaser. The payments
                                made to Creators do not include any Taxes (as defined below), and NFT TALENT
                                shall have no responsibility for payment of such Taxes regardless of the taxing
                                authority. Each party shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on its income or
                                property. Purchasers will be responsible for paying all such fees. In addition,
                                interactions with the Blockchain may also result in transaction fees or Gas Fees (as
                                defined below) imposed by the Blockchain, which are also solely your
                                responsibility. “Gas fees” mean the fees that fund the network of computers that
                                run the decentralized blockchain network, meaning that you will need to pay a Gas
                                Fee for each transaction that occurs via the blockchain network.

                                (iii) Revenue Share and Fees. If you are a Seller, will receive Revenue less the
                                Transaction Fee for each initial sale of your NFT on the NFT TALENT Platform.
                                “Transaction Fee” means the percentage of the Revenue generated from the initial
                                sale of your NFT sale of an NFT that is listed on the listing interface, as agreed by
                                You, when determining to list your NFT for sale. The Transaction Fee may be, but
                                is not required to be, the sale percentage for all sales of NFT and may be changed
                                from time to time prior to being agreed to on the listing interface with respect to.

                                applicable law or other legal requirements. We reserve the right, but are not
                                obligated, to remove or disable access to any content, including User Content, at
                                any time and without notice, including, but not limited to, if we, at our sole
                                discretion, consider it objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the
                                right to investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects the Services.
                                We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute
                                users who violate the law. The sale of stolen assets, assets taken without
                                authorization, and otherwise illegally obtained assets on the Service is prohibited.
                                If you have reason to believe that an asset listed on the Service was illegally
                                obtained, please contact us immediately. Listing illegally obtained assets may
                                result in your listings being canceled, your assets being hidden, or you being
                                suspended from the Services.

                                nfts are intangible digital assets. they exist only by virtue of the ownership record
                                maintained in the applicable blockchain network. any transfer of title that might
                                occur in any unique digital asset occurs on the decentralized ledger within such
                                blockchain network. we do not guarantee that we can affect the transfer of title or
                                right in any nfts or other digital assets, or that any associated payment will be
                                successful.

                                identity, legitimacy, or authenticity of assets on the services.

                                limited to, periodic system maintenance, scheduled or unscheduled, acts of god,
                                unauthorized access, viruses, denial of service or other attacks, technical failure of

                            <p>
                                You accept and acknowledge:

                                (a) The prices and liquidity of cryptocurrency assets (including any NFTs) are
                                extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially
                                and adversely affect the NFTs made available through the Services, which may
                                also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any
                                Purchasers of NFTs will not lose money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (b) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, Taxes apply to your
                                transactions through the Services. Neither NFT TALENT nor any NFT TALENT
                                affiliates are responsible for determining the Taxes that apply to such transactions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (c) Our Services do not store, send, or receive cryptocurrency assets. This is
                                because cryptocurrency assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record
                                maintained on its supporting Blockchain. Any transfer of cryptocurrency assets
                                occurs within the supporting Blockchain and not on the Services. Transactions in
                                NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental
                                transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in NFTs shall be deemed
                                to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or
                                time that you initiated the transaction.

                                (d) There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but
                                not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of
                                malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
                                unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and
                                acknowledge that NFT TALENT will not be responsible for any communication
                                failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using
                                the Services for transactions, however caused.
                            </p>

                                (e) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed
                                ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and

                                relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of

                                conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls
                                out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of
                                the Service will suffer.

                                but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets,
                                assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs,
                                and assets that may become untransferable. NFT TALENT reserves the right to

                                such as Ethereum are variable and may increase at any time. You further
                                acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value
                                while they are supplied to or from the Services. You further acknowledge that we

                                any resulting losses that you experience while accessing Services. Accordingly,
                                you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of
                                accessing and using and interacting with the Services.

                                providers involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services will be liable
                                for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, or damages for
                                lost profits, lost revenues, lost savings, lost business opportunity, loss of data or
                                goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of

                                from the use of or inability to use the services, whether based on warranty,

                                possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to
                                have failed of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
                                or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above
                                limitation may not apply to you.

                                liability of NFT TALENT and its agent, representatives, and affiliates arising out
                                of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or inability to use the

                                TALENT for use of the services or one hundred u.s. dollars ($100), if you have not
                                had any payment obligations to NFT TALENT, as applicable.

                                (c) the exclusions and limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental
                                elements of the basis of the bargain between NFT TALENT and you.

                                These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the U.S. Federal
                                Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California,
                                without regard to its conflict of law’s provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set
                                forth in Section 18 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes
                                (defined below) that you and NFT TALENT are not required to arbitrate will be
                                the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and NFT
                                TALENT each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

                                (a) Informal Resolution of Disputes. You and NFT TALENT must first attempt to
                                resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms
                                or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use
                                of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) informally. Accordingly, neither you nor
                                NFT TALENT may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty (60) days
                                after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing. As part of this
                                informal resolution process, you must deliver your written notices via hand or
                                firstclass
                                mail to us at NFT TALENT, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware

                                (b) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any Dispute will be
                                resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative
                                or consolidated action or proceeding. You and NFT TALENT agree that the U.S.
                                Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms,
                                and that you and NFT TALENT are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
                                participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of
                                these Terms.
                            </p>

                                (c) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 18(a) above: (i) we both may seek
                                to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the
                                right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin)
                                the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
                                Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by
                                the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration
                                Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The
                                AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party
                                who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to
                                AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
                                provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearings
                                will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a
                                different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive
                                authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                                enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

                                (d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
                                be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration
                                and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your
                                Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration, we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees
                                and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration,
                                you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent
                                provided under applicable law.
                            </p>

                                (e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 18(c) above,
                                the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
                                asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
                                favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
                                provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or
                                we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that
                                has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future
                                injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in
                                a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that
                                litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the
                                outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (f) Class Action Waiver. You and NFT TALENT agree that each may bring claims
                                against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or
                                class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, if the
                                parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
                                another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
                                form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to
                                be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null
                                and void.
                            </p>

                                (g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 18(g) of
                                these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent
                                jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the
                                other parts of these Terms will still apply.
                            </p>

                                obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices
                                incorporated in or accompanying the Services.

                            <h5>(b) Entire Agreement</h5>
                            <p>
                                These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
                                between
                                NFT TALENT and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and
                                replace all prior oral or written
                                Understandings or agreements between NFT TALENT and you regarding the
                                Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an
                                arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the
                                maximum extent permissible, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain
                                in full force and effect. Except where provided by applicable law in your
                                jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or
                                otherwise, without NFT TALENT’ prior written consent. Any attempt by you to
                                assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, without
                                such consent, will be null. NFT TALENT may freely assign or transfer these
                                Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and
                                inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Any notices or other communications provided by NFT TALENT under these
                                Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices
                                made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is
                                transmitted.
                            </p>
                            <h5>(d) Waiver of Rights</h5>
                            <p>
                                NFT TALENT’ failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
                                considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
                                provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
                                representative of NFT TALENT. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the
                                exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without
                                prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
                            </p>
